# Platform and Toolchain Definitions

The toolchain config is copied from the `@bazel_tools` repository, and then modified. The original version is copied here so we can merge in any changes from new versions of Bazel.

- `unix_cc_toolchain_config.bzl` is the original copy from `@bazel_tools`.
- `cc_toolchain_config.bzl` is our fork.

Here is the original file:

```
bazel-bloodlight/external/bazel_tools/tools/cpp/unix_cc_toolchain_config.bzl
```
